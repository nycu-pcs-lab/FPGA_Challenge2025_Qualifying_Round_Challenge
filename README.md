# üöÄ FPGA Challenge 2025 - Qualifying Round

Welcome to the **FPGA Challenge 2025 Qualifying Round**!  
This competition challenges participants to optimize machine learning models for FPGA deployment using **hls4ml**.  
Your goal is to design efficient models that **maximize accuracy** while **minimizing latency** under FPGA resource constraints.

---


## üõ† Challenge Overview
- 
- Develop and optimize machine learning models for FPGA implementation.
- Target task: **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**.
- Final results will be evaluated based on the performance of the **hls4ml-converted HLS model**:
  - Accuracy
  - FPGA resource usage
  - Inference latency

---

## üìä Performance Scoring System & Dataset

You can access detailed information about the scoring system and datasets on Kaggle for the task via the following links:

- üñºÔ∏è **[Image Classification Task Competition- Kaggle Page](#)** *(for testing your model and flow)*  
  ‚Üí *Note: Final evaluation will be conducted separately and is not based on Kaggle leaderboard.*

## üßÆ Scoring Criteria

Your final score will be based on three key components:

- **Accuracy**:  
  Evaluated using the CIFAR-10-based test set that is same as the one on Kaggle.

- **HLS Synthesis Results** *(provided by your submission)*:
  - **C Synthesis Results**:
    - **Resource Usage**: LUTs, DSPs, BRAMs
    - **Latency**: Inference delay (in seconds)
