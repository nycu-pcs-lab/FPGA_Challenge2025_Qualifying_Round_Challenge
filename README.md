# 🚀 FPGA Challenge 2025 - Qualifying Round

Welcome to the **FPGA Challenge 2025 Qualifying Round**! This competition challenges participants to optimize machine learning models for FPGA deployment using **HLS4ML**. Your goal is to design efficient models that maximize accuracy while minimizing hardware resource usage and latency.

---

## 🛠 Challenge Overview

- Develop and optimize machine learning models for FPGA implementation.
- Compete across two tasks: **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)** and **Anomaly Detection (ToyCar)**.
- Evaluate model accuracy, FPGA resource usage, and inference latency.
